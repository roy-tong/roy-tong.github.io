## 0. Abstract

Agents are becoming a new class of software consumer, yet the industry has no
common method for measuring how agents discover, choose, use, and depend on
software. Existing signals — downloads, stars, self-reported installs — measure
neither agents nor value. This paper defines AUAS, a measurement standard for the
agent software ecosystem: what counts as an opportunity, a selection, an
invocation, a consumption, and a contribution; how these are counted, compared,
and qualified; and what conclusions each level of evidence can support. The goal
is not a dashboard. It is a shared data language for tool developers, agent
platforms, model companies, registries, investors, and researchers.

## 1. Why Agent Usage Requires a New Measurement Model

Software distribution once had a readable chain: downloaded, installed, used. The
agent economy breaks every link:

```text
Install ≠ Available
Available ≠ Presented
Presented ≠ Selected
Selected ≠ Used
Used ≠ Useful
Useful ≠ Incremental Value
```

- *Install* and *available* describe the tool's presence, not the agent's behavior.
- *Presented* — entering the agent's decision context — is the true denominator for
  choice, and it is rarely observable today.
- *Selected* is a decision; *invoked* is an execution; *completed* is a result.
- *Consumed* means the result entered the task; *useful* means it mattered.
- *Incremental value* is the counterfactual: without the tool, would the outcome
  have been worse?

Advertising learned this lesson over decades: impressions are not conversions,
clicks are not value, and attribution is not incrementality. The agent software
ecosystem can adopt the discipline on day one. AUAS answers five questions:

> **Reach** — did my tool enter the agent's choice set?
> **Choice** — when the agent had a chance, did it pick me?
> **Use** — after selection, was it actually used?
> **Utility** — did the use produce a usable result?
> **Value** — without me, would the agent's outcome have been worse?

## 2. Measurement Objects

An observation is an *evidence unit*, not a *business measurement unit*. AUAS
defines the business units first:

| Object | Definition | Layer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opportunity | an agent had the tool in its decision context | Behavior |
| Invocation | the tool actually executed | Behavior |
| Task | the unit of work an invocation serves | Behavior |
| Client | an independent agent runtime / installation | Market |
| Project | the software entity packages/tools/skills roll up to | Market |
| Category | a comparable capability class (search, coding, …) | Market |
| Observation | evidence of one of the above (a signed receipt) | Evidence |

```
Evidence Layer:   Observation
                      ↓ reconstruct
Behavior Layer:   Opportunity · Invocation · Task
                      ↓ aggregate
Market Layer:     Client · Project · Category
```

Counting observations as usage double-counts every corroborated call; counting
invocations as value confuses behavior with utility. The layers are not
interchangeable.

## 3. Agent Tool Interaction Lifecycle

Each stage is defined by its numerator, its denominator, whether it is observable
or inferred, and the minimum evidence required.

| Stage | Definition | Observable | Minimum evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Presented | tool entered the agent's decision context (candidate set) | agent runtime (routing) | runtime-level observation |
| Selected | agent/runtime decided to call it | agent runtime | runtime-level observation |
| Invoked | execution began | both sides | any side observation |
| Completed | returned success/failure/denied | both sides | any side observation |
| Consumed | a later model request used the result | some platforms | platform signal |
| Contributed | result influenced the task outcome | — | **inference** |

*Discovered* is deliberately replaced by *Presented*. Discovery (`tools/list`,
registry search, skill lookup) says the tool exists; presentation says the tool
entered the agent's actual decision context — the difference between a billboard
that was rented and an ad that was shown. Three states with very different
business meaning:

```text
Available ✓ Presented ✓ Selected ✓   ← chosen
Available ✓ Presented ✓ Selected ✗   ← missed opportunity (Selection Rate denominator)
Available ✓ Presented ✗              ← never in the game (distribution gap)
```

## 4. Measurement Framework

AUAS defines **metric families**, not a universal KPI. A search tool, a payment
tool, and an enterprise SaaS tool have different value structures; one north star
cannot serve all.

**M1 Distribution — Reach.** Is my tool in the agent world?
`Available Clients · Presented Opportunities · Presentation Rate · Agent Host
Coverage · Model/Runtime Coverage`

**M2 Choice — the most agent-native family.** When the agent had a chance, did it
choose me?
`Selections · Selection Rate (Selected ÷ Presented) · Share of Choice ·
First-choice Rate · Substitution Rate · Switch Rate`

**M3 Execution — Use.** Was it usable after selection?
`Logical Invocations · Completion Rate · Success Rate · Error/Retry Rate ·
Latency · Cost`

**M4 Utility — effective use.** Did the agent actually use what was returned?
`Result Delivered Rate · Result Consumed Rate · Continuation Rate · Correction
Rate · Fallback Rate`

**M5 Outcome — Value.** Did it improve the task?
`Task Success Association · Contribution · Incremental Lift · Time Saved · Cost
Saved · Human Intervention Reduced`

### Selection Rate

\[
Selection\ Rate = \frac{Selected\ Opportunities}{Presented\ Opportunities}
\]

Tool A: presented 100,000, selected 5,000 → 5%. Tool B: presented 10,000, selected
4,000 → 40%. Absolute calls favor A; agent preference strongly favors B. Selection
Rate answers the question developers actually care about: *when the agent had the
chance, how often did it choose me?*

### Share of Agent Choice

For a capability category (say, web search) with several substitutable tools:

\[
SoC = \frac{tool\ selections}{all\ selections\ in\ comparable\ capability}
\]

A developer would then see not "1.2M calls" but:

```text
Search category
Exa       Presented Share 31% · Selection Share 44% · Selection Rate 58% · Repeat Selection 71%
```

This is agent-software market data, not telemetry.

## 5. Relationship Measurement

Across-time relationships, defined agent-natively:

| Relationship | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Trial | first use |
| Active | eligible usage within the period |
| Repeated | usage across multiple windows |
| Preferred | sustained first choice within comparable candidate sets |
| Dependent | task performance degrades significantly when the tool is removed |

Dependency is the long-term asset metric: the most valuable tool is not the most
called — it is the least replaceable. `Adoption → Preference → Utility →
Dependency` is an agent-native tool relationship model.

## 6. Attribution vs Incrementality

**A tool's participation in a successful task is not evidence that it caused the
success.**

- **Attribution measurement** is observational: which tools participated in the
  task chain. It supports claims of *association* and *contribution to the
  execution chain* — nothing more.
- **Incrementality measurement** is counterfactual: how much additional value did
  the tool create? The method is randomized comparison — treatment (tool
  available) vs control (tool invisible) — across task success, time, token cost,
  total tool calls, human intervention, and quality:

```text
Incremental Task Success = P(Success | Tool) − P(Success | No Tool)
Time Lift   = Time(control) − Time(tool)
Cost Lift   = Cost(control) − Cost(tool)
```

Advertising moved from last-click attribution to holdout groups and incrementality
testing for exactly this reason. Agent tools inherit the lesson. AUAS separates
the two measurement regimes from the first day.

## 7. Measurement Quality

Evidence quality is not coverage quality; both are not qualification quality; none
is methodology. A set of perfectly attested events covering 2% of agents is not
market data.

```text
Measurement Quality
├── Evidence        is this event real? (signature, corroboration)
├── Coverage        how much of the world did we see?
├── Qualification   does this count as real production use?
├── Sampling        sampled? with what uncertainty?
├── Identity        how well do identifiers resolve to projects?
└── Method/version  which statistics, which spec version?
```

### Qualified Agent Usage

Raw invocations are not qualified usage. A large share of future tool traffic
will not represent adoption: developer self-testing, CI, benchmarks, evals,
synthetic agents, health checks, retry storms, agent loops, replays, load tests,
demos. AUAS requires a **Usage Context** on every observation:

```text
production · development · test · benchmark · evaluation · synthetic · ci · unknown
```

Public adoption metrics default to `production` plus separately disclosed
`unknown`; benchmark, eval, test, CI, and synthetic usage are never mixed into
qualified usage. Context qualification may matter more than evidence grading in
deciding whether a leaderboard is believable.

## 8. Standard Reporting

### Measurement Label

Every published metric carries a label — a nutrition label for numbers, not a
quality score:

```text
Agent Usage Measurement Label
Standard version:   0.2
Window:             30 days
Usage context:      production
Agent hosts:        Claude Code, Codex
Coverage:           partial
Collection:         client + server
Corroborated:       68%
Sampling:           none
Unknown context:    12%
Synthetic excluded: yes
Identity coverage:  91%
```

The label does not grade the data; it discloses how the number was produced so
that the reader can judge its applicability.

### Measurement Profiles

AUAS defines standard profiles instead of a universal north star:

| Profile | North Star | Guardrails | Diagnostics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adoption | Active Clients | Qualified Usage Rate, Coverage | Presented, Selection Rate, Repeat |
| Reliability | Successful Completed Invocations | p95 latency, cost, retry | error type, host, version |
| Utility | Consumed Results | Correction Rate, Fallback Rate | completion→consumption conversion |
| Value | Incremental Task Success | Cost, Latency, Safety | task type, model, alternatives |

Organizations choose a profile by use case; the standard defines the families, not
the winner.

## 9. Interoperability

The standard is transport-neutral and vendor-neutral. Current infrastructure binds
to it as implementation examples, not as preconditions: MCP carries lifecycle
events and trace context; OpenTelemetry carries tool spans; Codex, Claude Code,
and DeepSeek Harness expose observation points with declared capability matrices.
Technical choices — signature algorithms, collection formats, storage — live in
the reference implementation and its profiles, so that the methodology does not
expire when the technology changes.

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Task boundaries.** What is the unit of a "task," and who defines it?
2. **Contribution.** How to measure result contribution beyond consumption?
3. **Incrementality.** How to run counterfactual experiments at ecosystem scale
   without disturbing production?
4. **Candidate-set observability.** Presentation is the key denominator; most
   runtimes do not expose it yet.
5. **Privacy.** How far can correlation and retention go under pseudonymity?
6. **Cross-agent identity.** Same client across Codex, Claude, and DSH — when is
   that knowable?

*The normative specification (Measurement Objects, Lifecycle, Metric Families,
Quality, Reporting) and the reference implementation (agent-used) are published
openly. Graduation to AUAS 1.0 requires two independent implementations, three
runtime profiles, two tool-side implementations, a public conformance suite with
canonical test vectors, 5–10 real projects, a published discrepancy report, and
security and privacy reviews.*
